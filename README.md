Tom Dickinson's Week 2 assignments for the Rampup program.


- **guessing_game.rb**
  - Randomly chooses a number between 1 and 100 (hint: use rand(100))
  - User has 5 chances to guess the right number
  - Ask for a guess. If they guess right then congratulate them and end the game.
  - If they guess wrong then tell them if it’s higher or lower, tell them how many chances they have left and let them guess again.
  - once all 5 of their chances are used up tell them they have no more chances, show the answer and end the game.
  - **NOTE:** Just for fun I threw in an extra feature, allowing the user to cheat by guessing 0 to gain more chances.
- **story_game.rb**
  - Make a ruby program that uses puts to print the following text:
  - “You’re a traveler on a long journey. After many miles, you come to a fork in the road. To the North is a small village.  To the East is dark cave. Which way do you go? North or East?”
  - Then use gets to store the user’s answer in a variable called direction.
  - Then use the direction variable in an if/else conditional:
    - What happens when the user chooses North?
    - What happens when the user chooses East?
  - **NOTE:** I kind of went a little crazy with this one and did my own thing... it's also not finished but I think it satisfies the assignment.
- **lab_1.rb**
  - Write a program that prints out the complete lyrics to “99 bottles of beer on the wall.”
- **lab_2.rb**
  - Write a Deaf Grandma program. Whatever you say to grandma(user input) she should respond with HUH?!, SPEAK UP SONNY!, unless you shout it(type in all CAPS). If you shout, she can hear you and yells back NO, NOT SINCE 1938! Grandma should shout a different year each time; random between 1930 to 1980. You can’t stop talking to grandma until you shout BYE.
- **lab_3.rb**
  - Add on to the above. Grandma really loves your company and doesn’t want you to go unless you shout BYE three times in a row. So if you say BYE twice and then something else you have to say BYE three times again.
